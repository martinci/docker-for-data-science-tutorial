    "With 32 tuotorials, 12 sponsor workshops, 16 talks at the education summit, and 95 talks at the main conference - Pycon has a lot to offer. Reading through all the talk descriptions and filtering out the ones that you should go to is a tedious process. But not anymore.\n",

    "## Introducing TalkRecommender\n",
    "Talk recommender is a recommendation system that recommends talks from this year's Pycon based on the ones that you went to last year.  This way you don't waste any time preparing a schedule and get to see the talks that matter the most to you! \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the demo, the users are asked to label previous year's talks into two categories - the one that they went to in person, and the ones they watched later online. Talk Recommender uses those labels to predict talks from this year that will be interesing to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) abd [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/) to build and the model.\n",
